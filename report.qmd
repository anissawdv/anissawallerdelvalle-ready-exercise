# Methods 

## Data acquisition
The dataset used in this study was provided with the data-analysis project template and can be found in data/raw-data. The dataset was updated to include two new variables, as described below. 

## Description of data and data source
Two new variables were added to the dataset and saved in exampledata2.xlsx. The first variable is age, reported as a numeric value >0 or non-applicable (NA) representing the age of each individual in years. The second variable is martial status, reported as either S (Single), M (Married), D (Divorced), W (Widowed), or NA. These variables are documented in the Codebook sheet of the updated dataset. 
Other variables include (1) height, reported in centimeters as a numeric value >0, (2) weight, reported in kilograms as a numeric value >0, and (3) gender, reported as either male, female, or other. 

## Data import and cleaning
Data import and cleaning were performed using scripts located in code/processing-code. This involved looking for obvious outliers (e.g., a weight of 7,000 kg) and removing them from the dataset, among other related processes. The cleaned dataset was saved as processeddata2.rds in the results directory for use in downstream analysis. 

## Statistical analysis
Exploratory data analysis was performed using the scripts in code/eda-code/eda-copy.qmd. A boxplot was generated to examine the distrubution of height in relation to marital status. A scatterplot was generated to examine the relationship between weight and age. These figures were saved to the results/figures directory. 

Linear models were used to further explore the data. In addition to previously specified models, a third linear model was fit with height as the outcome and age and marital status as predictors. These were saved as resulttable3.rds in the results/able directory. 

# Results

## Analysis
The dataset contained five variables: 
- Height, reported in centimeters.
- Weight, reported in kilograms.
- Gender, reported as either male, female, or other. 
- Age, reported in years.
- Marital Status, reported as either single, married, divored, or widowed.

We first conducted exploratory analyses to examine the distributions of age, height, and weight.  @fig-height-distribution shows the distribution of height.  @fig-weight-distribution shows the distribution of weight.  @fig-age-distribution shows the distribution of age. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-height-distribution
#| fig-cap: Distribution of Height 
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(
  here("results","figures","height-distribution.png")
)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-weight-distribution
#| fig-cap: Distribution of Weight 
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(
  here("results","figures","weight-distribution.png")
)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-age-distribution
#| fig-cap: Distribution of Age 
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(
  here("results","figures","age-distribution2.png")
)
```

@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table. All caption text goes here."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable <- readRDS(
  here("results","tables","summarytable.rds")
)
```

@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts to visualize the relationship between height and weight stratified by gender.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```

@fig-marital-distribution shows the distribution of marital status. @fig-marital-vs-height shows the boxplot generated in this analysis. Likewise, @fig-age-vs-weight shows the scatterplot generated in this analysis. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-marital-distribution
#| fig-cap: Distribution of Marital Status 
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(
  here("results","figures","marital-distribution.png")
)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-marital-vs-height
#| fig-cap: Marital Status vs. Height
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(
  here("results","figures","marital-vs-height.png")
)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-age-vs-weight
#| fig-cap: Age vs. Weight
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(
  here("results","figures","age-vs-weight.png")
)
```

Below is a summary of all linear model fits. 

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable1 <- readRDS(here("results","tables","resulttable1.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable1)

resulttable2 <- readRDS(here("results","tables","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)

resulttable3 <- readRDS(here("results","tables","resulttable3.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable3)
```
